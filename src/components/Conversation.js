                                    I am a fan of Football since I was in grade 3. My favorite club is Chelsea FC.  Throughout secondary and high school, I played several unprofessional football tournaments. And one of them is the XAMK tournament in Mikkeli

                                    I love cooking.  I can make 600+ pieces of sushi in 2 hours. Yea, 
                                    thatâ€™s true, I used to work in a sushi restaurant 
                                    and I definitely know a thing or two about sushi.

                                    That's an interesting question. To be honest, I don't learn to program just to get to Google, Facebook or some tech giant company. I want to learn programming to build something meaningful that help real people with real problems. It's just that simple :D
