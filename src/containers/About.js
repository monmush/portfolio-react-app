                        Hi, so I guess this page is all about me. As you probably know, my name is Minh (not "mean"). I come from Vietnam. And I am about to graduate from South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences.

                        I am a fan of Football since I was in grade 3. My favorite club is Chelsea FC.  Throughout secondary and high school, I played several unprofessional football tournaments. And one of them is the XAMK tournament in Mikkeli

                        I love cooking.  I can make 600+ pieces of sushi in 2 hours. Yea, 
                        thatâ€™s true, I used to work in a sushi restaurant 
                        and I definitely know a thing or two about sushi.

                        My second job is at Hills Dumplings - the restaurant was named one of the best new restaurant in Helsinki 2018 (according to myhelsinki.fi). So mate, I can definitely treat you well with some delicious food :D

                        That's an interesting question. To be honest, I don't learn to program just to get to Google, Facebook or some tech giant company. I want to learn programming to build something meaningful that help real people with real problems. It's just that simple :D
